    <h3>Information</h3>
    
    <h4>  Conan Edogawa is the alias used by Shinichi Kudo in his shrunken form.
        Shinichi took the appearance of his six or seven-year-old self after being exposed to a
        prototype poison called APTX 4869, which he had been forced to swallow by two men in black
        later revealed to be members of the Black Organization.
        The poison de-aged Shinichi's entire body except for his nervous system and therefore he
        still has the personality, memories, and incredible deductive ability of his teenage
        self.</h4>
